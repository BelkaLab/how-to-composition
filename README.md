Click the link above to open the recorded webinar and learn how to apply composition pattern. The practical exercise starts at **minute 16:50**.

In the webinar, we focus on applying the composition pattern with the following components:

- **Button** - `src/components/button/button.tsx`

- **Dialog** - `src/components/dialog/dialog.tsx`

These components are inspired by the ones we’ve crafted and used in our projects at Belka.
